## Installing Ruby

### Windows

There's an installer, it's easy.
http://rubyinstaller.org/

### Mac

Newer macs ship with a usable version of Ruby.

Try `ruby -v` in a terminal window, and if it's 1.9.x or 2.x you're fine.

Cloning an Existing Repository

If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository – for example, a project you’d like to contribute to – the command you need is git clone.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/raulcisternasw/sportsoccer.git
```

Go directory

```
$ cd sportsoccer/
```

Starting up the Web Server

You actually have a functional Rails application already. To see it, you need to start a web server on your development machine. You can do this by running the following in the blog directory:

```
$ rails server
```
